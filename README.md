These programs for the Arduino can automate various different things in Pokemon Sword/Shield.

These programs are similar to brianuuuSonic's Autocontroller programs. But they are generally faster, more reliable, and have a much smaller risk of killing dens.

## Demo Videos:

**Native Programs:**

These programs are flashed directly to the microcontroller and are run natively from it.
