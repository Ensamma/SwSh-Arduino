This is a public distribution mirror for the Pokemon Automation discord server's in-house Arduino programs for Pokemon Sword/Shield.

The latest releases and betas are in the discord server. This repo is merely a mirror that isn't always up-to-date.

-----

These programs for the Arduino can automate various different things in Pokemon Sword/Shield.

These programs are similar to brianuuuSonic's Autocontroller programs. But they are generally faster, more reliable, and have a much smaller risk of killing dens.
