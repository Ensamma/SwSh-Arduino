The latest releases and betas are in the discord server. This repo is merely a mirror that isn't always up-to-date.

These programs for the Arduino can automate various different things in Pokemon Sword/Shield.

These programs are similar to BrianuuuSonic's Autocontroller programs. But they are more expert-oriented and are more focused on speed and reliability.
