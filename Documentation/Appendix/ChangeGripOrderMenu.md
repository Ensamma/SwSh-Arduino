Pok√©mon Sword/Shield only allows one external controller to be connected at a time. If you enter the game with multiple controllers, all but the first one will be disconnected. Thus the Arduino must be the first controller.

When you enter grip menu, all external controllers will be disconnected. That way when the Arduino is connected, it will become controller #1.
