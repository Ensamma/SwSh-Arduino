# Maximizing Switch Stability

Some programs that are timing sensitive will recommend or require that Switch be put into a stabilized state where it is less likely to jitter and drop button presses.

This is most important to the day skippers, but it is also applicable to fault-intolerant programs like [MassRelease](../Programs/MassRelease.md) and [EggSuperCombined2](../Programs/EggSuperCombined2.md).

To maximize program stability:

1. Disconnect all controllers and Joy-Cons which are known to drift. (Don’t forget the attached Joy-Cons!)
2. Disconnect from the internet. Unplug the Ethernet cable if you’re wired up.
3. Turn on airplane mode. To run docked, undock the Switch, turn on airplane mode, then redock. The Switch will remain in airplane mode after redocking.
4. Restart the Switch if it’s been playing for a while.

Empirical evidence seems to suggest that completely isolating the Switch from outside interference (by shutting off all network traffic) improves stability and reduces the frequency of errors.
