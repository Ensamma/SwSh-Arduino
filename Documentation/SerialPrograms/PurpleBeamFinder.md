## Instructions

- Casual mode is off.
- Your text speed must be set to SLOW.
- You must stand in front of an empty den with watts collected.
- There must be no purple beams visible in the background. (or it may detect that instead.)
- You must be saved in the above position.
- Start the program in the [Change Grip/Order Menu](../Appendix/ChangeGripOrderMenu.md).

When the program finds a purple beam, it will make a lot of noise to get your attention.

## Options:

This program uses [`TOLERATE_SYSTEM_UPDATE_MENU_SLOW`](../Appendix/GlobalSettings.md#tolerate-system-update-menu-slow) to bypass the system update window.

### Extra Line

Talking to the den has an extra line in German. Set this to true if this is the case.

### Timeout Delay

Reset if no beam is detected after this long.
