# Friend Search Disconnect

Disconnect from the internet using the friend search method.

This program is useful for activating the Y-COMM glitch while playing on the computer or remotely. This is because:
1. You cannot enter airplane mode while docked.
2. You cannot sleep the Switch since the device cannot wake it back up.

Therefore, friend-search is the only remaining option.

## Instructions

- You are inside the game. (not the Switch Home or settings)
- The device is the primary controller.
- Run this program.

The program will quickly enter the Switch Home, navigate to the specified user profile, and perform a friend-search to disconnect from the internet.

To activate Y-COMM glitch using this program:

1. Use keyboard controls.
2. Open up Y-COMM.
3. Connect to the internet.
4. Start a link battle.
5. As soon as you match with someone, click "Start Program...".

The program will disconnect from the internet and return to the game.
