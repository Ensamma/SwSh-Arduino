## Instructions:

- Video resolution is 1280 x 720 or higher. Text recognition is not reliable at low resolutions.

## Options:

### Go Home when Done:

After finding a match, go to the Switch Home to idle. Turn this off for unattended streaming so that your viewers can see the shiny.

### Game Language:

Set this to the language of your game. (not your Switch) This is needed for text recognition.

### Gift Pokémon:

The Pokémon you are resetting for.

### Stats:

The desired IV spread for each stat.
